# Introduction 
Hi! My name is John and this is my porfolio. (Duh)

At first I thought uploading each proyect on a different repository (which is the most common way), but some of my proyects are very small in scale (A color picker, a minesweeper, tick-tack-toe, etc) so I thought it would be nice if I just had it all here so it's faster to check.

## Structure

In case you don't want to run the page you can manually type the route since all proyects follow this pattern:

pages/
├─ webs/
│  ├─ proyect_name/
├─ games/
│  ├─ game_name/
